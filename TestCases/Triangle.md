    Verify that the sum of the angles of the figure is 180 degrees.
    Verify that no two sides are perpendicular to each other
    Verify that the sum of the length of two sides of the traingle should be greater than length of the third side
    Verify that no two angles of triangle have 90 degree and above value.
