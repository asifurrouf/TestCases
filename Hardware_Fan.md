    Verify the ON-OFF functionality of fan
    Verify if the fan works normally-throws wind on the right direction
    Verify the material of which fan's blade and other parts are made
    Check the voltage/power requirement of the fan
    Verify the maximum speed of fan
    Check the minimum speed of the fan
    Verify that the speed of fan can be regulated using regulator
    Verify that when in motion, the fan should not wobble
    Check the length of the fan rod and blades
    Verify that the weight of the fan is as per the specifications
    Verify that the color of the fan is as per the specifications
    Check the effect of voltage fluctuation on fan when in motion
    Check the effect of sudden electricity outage on fan's motor and other electrical parts
    Verify the fan's condition when continuously switched on for very large duration
    Check if there is any life time of fan's internal parts or the body
    Check if the blades of the fan can be bend or not, check if its material is brittle
    Check the time taken by fan to attain maximum speed, when switched ON
